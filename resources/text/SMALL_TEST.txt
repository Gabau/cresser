The exec() family of functions replaces the current process image
with a new process image.  The functions described in this manual
page are layered on top of execve(2).  (See the manual page for
execve(2) for further details about the replacement of the
current process image.)

The initial argument for these functions is the name of a file
that is to be executed.

The functions can be grouped based on the letters following the
"exec" prefix.
